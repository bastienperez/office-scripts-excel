# Convert CSV Rows to Columns Script

## Description

This script is designed to convert CSV data contained in each row of the active Excel sheet into separate columns.
Automatically adjusts the column widths and row heights to fit the content.
Adds an auto-filter to the first row, allowing to filter and sort the data easily.

## Features

- **CSV Conversion**: Each row in the active sheet is processed to detect CSV-formatted data. The comma-separated values (or any other specified delimiter) are then distributed across multiple columns in the same row.
- **Automatic Adjustment**: The script automatically adjusts the column widths and row heights to fit the content after conversion.
- **Auto-Filter Application**: An auto-filter is applied to the first row, enabling easy filtering and sorting of data across columns.
## Usage

See [README.md](..) for more details.
