# Convert CSV Rows to Columns Script

## Description

This script is designed to convert CSV data contained in each row of the active Excel sheet into separate columns. It also automatically adjusts the column widths and row heights to fit the content.

## Features

- **CSV Conversion**: Each row in the active sheet is processed to detect CSV-formatted data. The comma-separated values (or any other specified delimiter) are then distributed across multiple columns in the same row.
- **Automatic Adjustment**: The script automatically adjusts the column widths and row heights to fit the content after conversion.

## Usage

See [README.md](../README.md) for more details.
